# [Linktivities](https://linktivities.fly.dev/) 

A complete social network coded in .Net and React.

The intent of this project is to follow the most recommended way to build a complex system. So it was built following SOLID principles and Clean Architecture, aiming to have a scalable, maintainable, and testable codebase. The communication between layers is handled by the Mediator pattern, which centralizes requests and decouples components, leading to a better separation of concerns and more organized code.
